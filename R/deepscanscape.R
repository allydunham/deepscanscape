#' deepscanscape: Check and Annotate Deep Mutational Scanning Data
#'
#' The deepscanscape package provides functions to standardise deep
#' mutational scanning data and compare it to a deep mutational landscape
#' calculated from a dataset of 28 previous studies. This allows the whole
#' dataset to be checked for unusual properties and individual positions
#' to be annotated with positional subtypes, indicating the positions in other
#' proteins they are most similar to.
