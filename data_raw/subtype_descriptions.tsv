wt	cluster	group	description	notes
A	A1	Not aromatic	Tolerates smaller residues	These positions tolerate smaller residues, generally being buried in the protein and tending to be near other hydrophobic residues
A	A2	Aliphatic	Selects against (most) polar, charged & aromatic	These positions select for hydrophobic residues, as well as tolerating serine, threonine and cysteine, all of which are small and likely don't disrupt the structure with polarity (potentially h-bonding to the backbone to resolve dipoles). They are also usually buried
A	A3	Not proline	Anything but proline (weaker than usual)	Spread throughout proteins these positions are only selective against proline. They are less conserved than other subtypes
A	A4	Not aromatic	Selects against aromatic and larger hydrophobic	These positions select against aromatics and larger hydrophobic residues. Often surface accessible they likely interact badly with the solvent/prefer to be buried and disrupt the structure when a larger hydrophobic group is added
A	A5	Small aliphatic	Strong selection, tolerates glycine & serine	Highly selective, these positions only tolerate glycine and serine. They are often buried, although not as strongly as A1/2
A	AP	Permissive	Permissive positions	Very depleted in beta strands compared to other subtypes. They are very surface accessible
A	AO	Outlier	Outlier	
C	C1	Unique	Highly selective, cysteine only functions such as disulphide bonds	FoldX and chemical environment results suggest disulphide bonds generally go here, although not exclusively (33% of C1 positions vs 8% in C2). The subtype likely also contains other positions where only C functions, such as ion conjugation, and potentially includes similar aromatic interactions to C2 where the interaction is highly important. The subtype is least selected against aromatics - maybe because the aromatic/sulphur interaction partially makes up for the disulphide bond, or also fulfils some of the other functions
C	C2	Aliphatic	Selective against hydrophilic amino acids, much more buried, includes cysteine/aromatic interactions.	This subtypes appears to use cysteine's hydrophobicity as well as the sulphur/aromatic interaction that allows cysteine to create stabilising interactions with aromatics (Orabi & English 2016). The characteristic aromatic interaction pattern occurs in the subtypes mean profile and somewhat in the chemical environment, although the enrichment for aromatic neighbours is weaker than when it was an exclusive group (likely because it is swamped by residues without the interaction). In some sense this subtype could be manually split into two, although that is generally not identified algorithmically (apart from a single lucky run of kmeans). These positions tend to be more strongly buried than C1 positions, although both generally are
